# ES2020 (ECMAScript 2020)

**Release Year:** 2020

## Major Highlights

- **Optional Chaining (`?.`)** - Safe property access
- **Nullish Coalescing (`??`)** - Default for null/undefined only
- **BigInt** - Arbitrary precision integers
- **Promise.allSettled()** - Wait for all promises (success or failure)
- **globalThis** - Universal global object
- **Dynamic import()** - Import modules dynamically
- **String.matchAll()** - Get all regex matches
- **Module namespace exports** - `export * as name`

## Why This Version Changed How JavaScript Is Written

ES2020 brought two **game-changing** features:

- **Optional chaining (`?.`)** eliminated countless null checks
- **Nullish coalescing (`??`)** fixed the 0/false default value problem

These features dramatically reduced boilerplate and bugs. They're now used in virtually every modern JavaScript codebase. BigInt enabled precise large number calculations, and Promise.allSettled() filled a gap in Promise utilities.
