# ES3 (ECMAScript 3)

**Release Year:** 1999

## Major Highlights

- **Regular Expressions** - Pattern matching for strings
- **Try/Catch Exception Handling** - Proper error handling
- **Better String Handling** - String methods like `split()`, `concat()`, `match()`
- **Array Methods** - `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `splice()`
- **Switch Statement** - Multi-way branching

## Why This Version Changed How JavaScript Is Written

ES3 was the first standardized, widely-adopted version of JavaScript. It established JavaScript as a serious programming language by adding:

- **Structured error handling** instead of relying on undefined behavior
- **Regular expressions** for powerful text processing
- **Core array manipulation methods** that are still used today
- **Consistent behavior** across different browsers

This version laid the foundation for modern JavaScript and remained the dominant version for over a decade (until ES5 in 2009).
