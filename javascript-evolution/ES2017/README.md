# ES2017 (ECMAScript 2017)

**Release Year:** 2017

## Major Highlights

- **async/await** - Syntactic sugar for Promises
- **Object.values()** - Get object values as array
- **Object.entries()** - Get key-value pairs as array
- **Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()** - Get all property descriptors
- **String padding** - `padStart()` and `padEnd()`
- **Trailing commas** in function parameters
- **SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics** - Shared memory and atomic operations

## Why This Version Changed How JavaScript Is Written

ES2017 brought **async/await**, arguably the most impactful syntax since Promises:

- **Async code looks synchronous** - Massive readability improvement
- **Error handling** with try/catch works naturally
- **Object iteration** became simpler with values() and entries()
- **String formatting** improved with padding methods

async/await transformed how JavaScript developers write asynchronous code, making it the default pattern for async operations. This single feature revolutionized JavaScript async programming.
