# ES2016 (ECMAScript 2016)

**Release Year:** 2016

## Major Highlights

- **Exponentiation Operator (`**`)** - Power calculations
- **Array.prototype.includes()** - Check if array contains a value

## Why This Version Changed How JavaScript Is Written

ES2016 was the first **small, incremental** release after ES6. It established the new yearly release cycle with focused improvements rather than massive changes.

While only two features were added, they addressed common pain points:

- **Exponentiation operator** replaced `Math.pow()` with cleaner syntax
- **Array.includes()** provided intuitive element checking

This version proved that JavaScript could evolve steadily with smaller, well-tested features added annually rather than waiting years for major releases.
