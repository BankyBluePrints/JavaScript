## Why This Version Changed How JavaScript Is Written

ES5 was a major milestone that brought JavaScript into the modern era:

- **Functional programming** became practical with array methods
- **JSON became standardized** for data exchange
- **Strict mode** helped catch bugs early
- **Object manipulation** became more powerful and flexible
- **No new syntax** - focused on new methods and capabilities

ES5 remained the target for web development for many years and is still fully supported everywhere. It represents the minimum modern standard for JavaScript development.
